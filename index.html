           						<h3>Overview</h3>
           						<div align="left">
           						<p>Loans issued tend to be stable. In 2007: All the loans were issued with an average amount below $15k, where average income of debtors range from $20k to $180k. Over time, the range of loan amount gathers together towards $13k and $25k, and the range of debtors’ average income converges to 65k and 100k.</p>
           						<p>From the animation, we can see that this trend is pretty obvious. The reason is highly likely to be the change of Lending Club’s loan issuing strategy. At the beginning of their business, it was reasonable to take some risk to issue the loans to people with different annual income, while remain a low issuing amount to avoid too much loss.</p>
           						<p>With time, after they discover more patterns, and being more accurate in risk controlling, they increased the loan amount gradually, and concentrate the customer group to those who have annual income within a smaller range.</p>
           						<p>Another phenomenon is that Lending Club issue loans with amounts that are relatively a quarter of debtors’ annual incomes.</p>
           						</div>
           						
           						<h3>Take a closer look</h3>
           						<div align="left">
           						<p>By looking at particular 1 grade at a time, we noticed that with the lower risk level (A-D) of loan grade, the issuing strategy is more cautious, basically there is not much huge movement with the bubbles, while higher risk level loans (such as F and G) changes massively.</p>
           						<p>Grade G loans were issued aggressively during 2011-2013, but 2012 was a year that the company made a pause and went back to a conservative plan. In 2015, we saw that all grades of loans were together within such grids.</p>

         						<h3>Overview</h3>
         						<div align="left">
         						  
         						<p>The most important numerical features in this data, loan amount and the count of loan issued, are sometimes hard to visualize to show insights. Usually it is a good idea to scale them into 100%. In this plot, each year’s total number of loan issued represents 100%, the quantity of loans for each grade has their percentage out of it. </p>
         						<p>Even though it is hard to contribute all changes to a specific category, such as whether it is affected by the country’s economy, the living quality of people, or the issuing policy change of Lending Club, it is still useful to take a look at the relative trend of each grade of loans over time. </p>
         						<p>Remember that from the last plot, we saw that F and G grade loans were issued with aggressive strategy, but from this plot, it shows that the number of its issuance were very stable.</p>
         						<p>The company might consider to increase its issuance by trying different kind of strategies, which was reflected from the last plot, but it doesn’t seem to work well. The percent of number of issuance of lower level loans do not seem to be surged.</p>
